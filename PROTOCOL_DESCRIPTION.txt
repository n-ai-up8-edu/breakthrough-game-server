This document describes a breakthrough text protocol.

In this version, communications between server and clients are blocking tcp communications. After each command, the reply is "= [RESULTS]" where '=' means success. If the command is not understandable, then the reply is "? [COMMENTS]" where '?' means error.
RESULTS and COMMENTS are a single line string, where ';' indicates new line.

To start the server, you have to specify a port number.
$>./server 1234

To connect a client, you have to specify server's hostname and port number.
$>.client localhost 1234

here are all the command :
 help
 id PLAYER_NAME PLAYER_PASSWD
 get_state
 new_game MY_COLOR 
 del_game GAME_ID
 list_games
 list_players
 join_game GAME_ID 
 show_board
 get_board_str
 get_turn [GAME_ID]
 play POS_I:POS_F
 resign
 get_last
 get_score
 quit

Board coordinates to set POS_I and POS_F inside 'play' command :
   A B C D E F G H
8  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
7  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
6  . . . . . . . .
5  . . a . . . . .
4  . . . b . . . .
3  . . . . . . . .
2  o o o o o o o o
1  o o o o o o o o

black pawns are represented with @
white pawns are represented with o
empty spaces are represented with .
position a is C5
position b is D4
playing from a to b is only possible for black player
sending "play C5:D4\n" is asking to move from a to b
